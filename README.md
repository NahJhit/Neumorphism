# VERY EARLY DEVELOPMENT

## I know there's tons of bugs, literally just released as a beta

### Give feedback in the form of ideas, not bug reports, we're fixing them constantly and themeing stuff

#### This theme is basically just trying to make discord look nice with the neumorphism effect, will add stuff to customize colors and things eventually
